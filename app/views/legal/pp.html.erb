		<h1>Privacy Policy.</h1>

		<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Ettúi we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>

			<li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>

			<li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, this privacy policy is available under a <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/'>Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license, which means you're more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use.)</p>

		<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact <a href='mailto:henrik@ettui.com'>Henrik</a>, the founder of Ettúi.</p>

		<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

		<p>Like most website operators, Ettúi collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ettúi's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ettúi's visitors use its website. From time to time, Ettúi may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

		<p>Ettúi also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Ettúi only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators where the comment was left.</p>

		<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

		<p>Certain visitors to Ettúi’s websites choose to interact with Ettúi in ways that require Ettúi to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Ettúi gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Ettúi are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Ettúi collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Ettúi. Ettúi does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

		<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

		<p>Ettúi may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Ettúi may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Ettúi does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

		<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

		<p>Ettúi discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Ettúi’s behalf or to provide services available at Ettúi’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Ettúi’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Ettúi will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Ettúi discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Ettúi believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Ettúi, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Ettúi website and have supplied your email address, Ettúi may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Ettúi and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Ettúi takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>

		<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Ettúi uses cookies to help Ettúi identify and track visitors, their usage of Ettúi website, and their website access preferences. Ettúi visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Ettúi’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Ettúi’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

		<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

		<p>If Ettúi, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Ettúi goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Ettúi may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

		<h2>Ads</h2>

		<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Ettúi and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

		<h2>Comments</h2>

		<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>

		<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

		<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Ettúi may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Ettúi’s sole discretion. Ettúi encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
